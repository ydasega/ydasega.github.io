My name is Yohannes D. Asega. I am interested in algebraic geometry. 

The blog's title, _dessin dâ€™enfant_ is a hypermap seen as a representation of a [Belyi
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belyi's_theorem#Belyi_functions): a meromorphic function $f:X\rightarrow \bar{\mathbb{C}}$ whose
only critical values are 0, 1, and $\infty$. [[ncatlab]](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/child's+drawing). It also means "child's drawing"--analogous to my attempt at navigating mathematics.
