* [Dedekind's Theorem: Mod *p* reduction](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lcp1u6xxhbg1c2o/dedekind_theoerem_mod_p_reduction.pdf).
    In this expository paper, we prove Dedekindâ€™s theorem---a result on the calculation of the Galois group of any monic polynomial $f$ of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ by reducing $f$ mod $p$, for some appropriate primes $p$.

* [Chow's Theorem](https://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1884&context=honorstheses). We present the proof of Chow's theorem as a corollary to J.P.-Serre's GAGA correspondence theorem after introducing the necessary prerequisites. Finally, we discuss consequences of Chow's theorem.
