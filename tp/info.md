About _dessin d’enfant_
========

I am an undergraduate mathematics student and this is my math blog. I will be posting
notes on things I am studying/thinking about.

The blog's title, _dessin d’enfant_ is a hypermap seen as a representation of a [Belyi
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belyi's_theorem#Belyi_functions): a meromorphic function $f:X\rightarrow \bar{\mathbb{C}}$ whose
only critical values are 0, 1, and $\infty$. [[ncatlab]](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/child's+drawing)

In English, it means _child's drawing_. It was first used by Grothendieck in his
proposal Esquisse d'un Programme to probably his last mathematical project.  I first learned
of this from my undergarduate mentor Prof. Fernando Q. Gouvêa. Anyway, I
have used it here because it _literally_ captures my mathematical journey.
