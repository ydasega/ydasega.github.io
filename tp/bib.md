Quotes
===========
These are quotes that were influential to me. I found most of them in a 1913 book called *On Mathematics and Mathematicians* by Robert E. Moritz.

>*Every mathematical book that is worth reading must be read "backwards and forwards," if I may use the expression. I would modify Lagrange's
advice a littel and say, "Go on, but often return to strengthen your faith." When you come on a hard or dreary passage, pass it over; and come back
to it after you have seen its importance or found the need for it further on.*

-**Chrystal, George** [Algebra, Part 2 (Edinburgh, 1889), Preface, p. 8]
